What is State in React?
In React, state is an object that stores data that can change over time and cause the component to re-render when updated. It allows components to be dynamic and interactive.

why props used?
In React, props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another (usually from a parent to a child component).
✅ Reusable Components – Pass different data to make components reusable.
✅ Dynamic Content – Display different content in the same component.
✅ Parent-Child Communication – Send data from a parent component to a child.
